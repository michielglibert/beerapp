# Beer tracker
A beer app for ios that lets you add beers you drank, add the location, give it a rating and mark your favorite ones.
This application is made for a school project, you are free to use this for any purpose.

## Running the app

The app does not have any dependencies so it should run without any issues. I did use https://github.com/evgenyneu/Cosmos for adding "rating stars" to the app but it is a swift class, not a dependency. The app was developed in Xcode 9.2 for ios 11
