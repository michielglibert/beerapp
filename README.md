# Beer tracker
A beer app for ios that lets you add beers you drank, add the location, give it a rating and mark your favorite ones.
This application is made for a school project, you are free to use this for any purpose.

## Running the app

The app does not have any dependencies so it should run without any issues. I did use https://github.com/evgenyneu/Cosmos for rating stars but it is a swift class, not a dependency. Xcode 9 was used and the app was developed in ios 11.

## Information about the app

This app was made for a school project to show my skills. A quick overview of what my app shows:

* SearchBar
* Multiple navigationControllers
* Multiple tableviews (both static and dynamic)
* Using autolayout, stackviews and size classes (Best showed in profile view)
* Actionsheets
* Using segues (unwind, show, ...)
* Basic actions for a beer: view, add, edit and delete
* MVC pattern used
